/*
 * - This class is used to represent the details of a user during the authentication and authorization process.
 * - Acts as a bridge between your application's user model and Spring Security's authentication mechanisms.
 * - It uses this object to store and retrieve user information during the authentication process.
 * - It holds the essential details that Spring Security needs, like the username, password, and authorities (roles/permissions).
 * - This allows Spring to know which roles the user has and enforce authorization rules accordingly.
 * - This is a simplified representation of the user entity that focuses on authentication and authorization.
